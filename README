[Simple/Slick/Stupid/Smart/../Slimy/Sexy] Sky Dome Projector (SSDP)
(have not decided yet which adjective fits best, there is just so many)

A library for modeling irradiance taking into accound the local 
topography. It implements a hexagonal mesh for the sky and the Perez 
all weather sky model. For the topography it works with a point cloud 
of x,y,z coordinates. It can compute the horizon as seen from a 
specific location in the topography and can project the modelled sky 
dome onto a surface with a specified tilt and orientation. The surface 
location and orientation may be adapted to the topography (e.g. specify 
height above the surface and adapt the orientation to the surface 
normal)
