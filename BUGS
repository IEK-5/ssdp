The shull code is fragile and somewhat buggy. If you experience 
problems you will have to resort to using regular grids

Reconfiguring locations seems to segfault

Number of angles in the horizon should be configurable independent from 
sky patches.

Integration should not put the sun into sky patches. The integration 
should integrate the diffuse light over patches and then run direct POA 
simulations for the same time series.
